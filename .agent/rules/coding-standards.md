CODING STANDARDS

Language:
- TypeScript only

Code style:
- functional components
- small, focused files
- descriptive names
- avoid magic values

Practices:
- no premature optimization
- comments only where intent is not obvious
- prefer clarity over cleverness

The codebase should be readable by another developer without explanation.
