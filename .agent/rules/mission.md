PROJECT MISSION

JLens is a modern, browser-based JSON viewer and explorer.

Its purpose is to:
- make JSON data easy to read, inspect and understand
- provide a clean and pleasant user experience
- work entirely client-side
- require zero setup for the user

JLens is a tool for developers and technical users.
Clarity and usability are more important than feature quantity.
